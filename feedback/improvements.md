# Landing Page Improvements

## 1. Mobile Navigation

**Reason:** Current navigation links become cramped on mobile devices, creating poor UX. A hamburger menu is the standard mobile pattern.


## 2. Add Product Screenshots

**Reason:** Visual proof of the product increases trust and conversion. Text-heavy pages lack visual engagement.


**Image requirements:**
- Format: PNG or WebP
- Dimensions: 1200x800px (desktop), 800x600px (mobile)
- Naming: `screenshot-1.png`, `screenshot-2.png`, etc.

## 3. Add Email Capture

**Reason:** Convert visitors before they leave. Email capture enables follow-up marketing and early access notifications.

## 4. Add Hero Image

**Reason:** Hero images increase visual appeal and help users understand the product immediately. Reduces bounce rate.

## Notes

- Maintain existing design system (colors, typography, glassmorphism)
- Ensure all additions are responsive and accessible
- Test on mobile devices (320px - 768px)
- Optimize all images before adding to site
- Add proper alt text for accessibility
